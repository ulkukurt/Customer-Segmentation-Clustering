# Customer-Segmentation-Clustering
Customer Personality Analysis helps businesses understand their customers better, enabling them to tailor products to different customer segments. Instead of marketing a new product to every customer, companies can focus on the segments most likely to buy, leading to more efficient and effective marketing efforts.
